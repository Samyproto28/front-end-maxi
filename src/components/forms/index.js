// Re-exports for form components
export { default as VotosInput } from './VotosInput.vue'
export { default as TelegramaForm } from './TelegramaForm.vue'

// Example re-exports (uncomment and modify as components are created)
// export { default as InputField } from './InputField.vue'
// export { default as SelectField } from './SelectField.vue'
// export { default as CheckboxField } from './CheckboxField.vue'
// export { default as RadioField } from './RadioField.vue'
// export { default as TextAreaField } from './TextAreaField.vue'
// export { default as FileUpload } from './FileUpload.vue'
// export { default as Form } from './Form.vue'
// export { default as FormActions } from './FormActions.vue'

// For now, this file is ready to receive component exports
