/**
 * Layout Components Index
 *
 * This file serves as a central export point for all layout-related components.
 * Re-export layout components here to enable clean imports throughout the application.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * import { AppHeader, AppSidebar, AppFooter } from '@/components/layout'
 */

// Example re-exports (uncomment and modify as components are created)
// export { default as AppHeader } from './AppHeader.vue'
// export { default as AppSidebar } from './AppSidebar.vue'
// export { default as AppFooter } from './AppFooter.vue'
// export { default as AppLayout } from './AppLayout.vue'
// export { default as Navbar } from './Navbar.vue'
// export { default as Sidebar } from './Sidebar.vue'
// export { default as Breadcrumbs } from './Breadcrumbs.vue'

// For now, this file is ready to receive component exports
