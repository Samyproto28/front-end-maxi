/**
 * Table Components Index
 *
 * This file serves as a central export point for all table-related components.
 * Re-export table components here to enable clean imports throughout the application.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * import { DataTable, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/tables'
 */

// Example re-exports (uncomment and modify as components are created)
// export { default as DataTable } from './DataTable.vue'
// export { default as TableHeader } from './TableHeader.vue'
// export { default as TableRow } from './TableRow.vue'
// export { default as TableCell } from './TableCell.vue'
// export { default as TablePagination } from './TablePagination.vue'
// export { default as TableActions } from './TableActions.vue'
// export { default as TableFilter } from './TableFilter.vue'
// export { default as TableSearch } from './TableSearch.vue'

// For now, this file is ready to receive component exports
